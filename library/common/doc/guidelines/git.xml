<title>Git Repository</title>

<para>
The Git repository should not include generated files unless they are needed to
use the library out of the box (such as parser Eiffel classes generated from .y files).
However, when such generated files are committed in the repository, 
you should pay attention to the fact that the generated files and the files
from which they are generated should be kept in sync. In particular,
don't modify a generated parser Eiffel class directly. First modify the
associated .y file, then regenerate the Eiffel class, and eventually
commit both files to the repository.
