  <title>The Output URI Resolver</title>    
  <para>
    This interface is used to resolve the destination URI specified by the 
    <featurename>href</featurename> attribute of <featurename>xsl:result-document</featurename>. 
    It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> used to resolve the principal output destination, as that is under the direct control of
    the user of the XSLT library, not the stylesheet author.
  </para>
  <section>
    <title>Features</title>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>security_manager</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <link linkend="security_manager"><classname>XM_XSLT_SECURITY_MANAGER</classname></link> is an interface
	    which allows pluggable security policies. When the output resolver's <featurename>resolve</featurename> routine 
	    is called, it in turn is supposed to call <featurecall><featurename>is_output_uri_permitted</featurename></featurecall>
	    on the security manager, to check that it is permitted to write to the URI in question.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>output_destinations</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This is a map of output URIs to the <link linkend="transformation_result"><classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT</classname></link>s
	    allocated to them. This is particularly useful when the principal output destination is to
	    a <classname>STRING</classname> (selected by a <uri>string:</uri> URI), and the <xslt>href</xslt>
	    attribute of <xslt>xsl:result-document</xslt> supplies a relative URL. In this case, the output resolver
	    will allocate a <link linkend="transformation_result"><classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT</classname></link> that wraps a 
	    <classname>STRING</classname>. The Eiffel programmer can then retrieve this as it is indexed by the absolute URI.
	    For example, if the principal output destination (as supplied by the Eiffel programmer) is <uri>string:</uri>,
	    and the stylesheet specifies <uri>href="one"</uri>, then the absolute URI is <uri>string:/one</uri>,
	    and this can be used to retrieve the <link linkend="transformation_result"><classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT</classname></link>, and
	    hence the <classname>STRING</classname>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This map is also used to ensure that no attempt is made to write two different result trees to the same destination URI. 
	  </para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>resolve</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This routine is called to create an <link linkend="transformation_result"><classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT</classname></link>
	    for the output destination.
	    But first, it must check with the security manager for permission to write to the URI.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If resolution is successful, <featurename>last_result</featurename> must be set to the created <classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT</classname>, 
	    which must also stored in <featurename>output_destinations</featurename>. If resolution is <emphasis>not</emphasis> successful, then
	    <featurename>error_message</featurename> must be set to an explanatory message.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>close</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	   This routine is called when the result tree has been completely written to the output destination.
	   It can perform actions such as closing the output stream where appropriate, and might also be used for 
	   firing off other actions, such as letting a job scheduler know that an output file is available.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	   An <classname>XM_XSLT_OUTPUT_PROPERTIES</classname> object is passed to the routine so
	   that MIME information is available for URI schemes that need it.

    <title>The default output resolver: <classname>XM_XSLT_DEFAULT_OUTPUT_URI_RESOLVER</classname></title>
    <para>
      This is the only concrete output resolver provided by the library. If it is not suitable for your needs,
      then you must write your own, and supply it as the third argument to 
      <link linkend="configuration"><classname>XM_XSLT_CONFIGURATION</classname>'s</link> creation procedure, <featurename>make</featurename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This output resolver handles <featurename>resolve</featurename> requests by passing them to an instance of
      <classname>XM_XSLT_OUTPUT_URI_SCHEME_RESOLVER</classname>, according to the scheme of the URI concerned.
    </para>
    <para>
      The resolver comes pre-configured with handlers for the <uri>file</uri>, <uri>stdout</uri>,
      and <uri>string</uri> protocols. The latter two are Gobo-specific protocols, for writing to the standard output stream
      and a <classname>STRING</classname>, repectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      Support for additional schemes may be added by calling <featurecall><featurename>register_scheme</featurename></featurecall>.
