  <title>Transformation Result</title>    
  <para>
    <classname>XM_XSLT_TRANSFORMATION_RESULT</classname> is a wrapper for the various classes which might receive
    a result document from a transformation.
  </para>
  <section>
    <title>Creation Procedures</title>
    <para>
      The creation procedure <featurename>make_secondary_stream</featurename> is only used for
      creating secondary streams, that is, those created by an <xslt>xsl:result-document</xslt>. 
      Accordingly, users of the library will not use it directly.
    </para>
    <para>
      The other creation procedures are for creating the primary result. Since the Eiffel programmer
      <emphasis>must</emphasis> use one of these when invoking <featurecall><featurename>transform</featurename></featurecall>,
      it is worth going into them in some detail.
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>make (a_stream: XM_OUTPUT; a_system_id:STRING)</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This will be the one you normally want to use. You create <featurename>a_stream</featurename>
	    using whichever creation procedure of <classname>XM_OUTPUT</classname> you find appropriate, and
	    you couple a <exmlsyntax>SYSTEM</exmlsyntax> id with it.
	    <warning>
		This should be an absolute URI, especially if you use any <xslt>xsl:result-document</xslt>s
		with relative URIs for their <xslt>href</xslt> attribute, as they will be resolved realative
		to the one you supply.
	    </warning>
	    <warning>
	      If you use any <xslt>xsl:result-document</xslt>s with relative URIs for their <xslt>href</xslt> 
	      attribute, then make sure that your URI scheme is one that 
	      <link linkend="output_resolver">your output resolver</link> can cope with.
	    </warning>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>make_receiver (a_receiver: XM_XPATH_RECEIVER)</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    With this creation procedure, you direct the output to an XPath library event stream. This
	    would be an appropriate choice if you wanted to immediately run another transformation
	    against the output from the first transformation.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    I have added an extension attribute to <xslt>xsl:output/xsl:result-document</xslt> so
	    that you will be able to specify a next transformation to run automatically. But even so,
	    this option might be useful in some circumstances.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
	<term><featurename>make_emitter (an_emitter: XM_XSLT_EMITTER)</featurename></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    This creation procedure enables you to direct output directly to an emitter
	    (which is the XSLT library's serialization class). Normally the transformer will create
	    an emitter for you, based on the attributes specified on <xslt>xsl:output/xsl:result-document</xslt>,
	    so I don't think this creation procedure is needed, but you might decide otherwise.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    I'm trying to think of a scenario in which this might be wanted. The only far-fetched idea I've been able to
	    come up with, is if you have a chain of transformations, and you want to use the output attributes from the 
	    <xslt>xsl:output</xslt> in the first stylesheet (rather than the last, which is the normal situation). In which
	    case you could create an emitter based on the initial <xslt>xsl:output</xslt>, and then pass it to this creation
	    procedure. You would then pass the created transformation result to the last transform in the chain (and use 
	    <featurename>make_receiver</featurename> for the previous steps in the chain).
