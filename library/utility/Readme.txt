Gobo Eiffel Utility Library

This library contains pattern classes as described in "Design Patterns"
from the "Gang of Four", and utility classes which does not deserve to
have a library on their own. The aim of this library is to always be under
construction.

Clusters:

command
    Executable commands. Useful to encapsulate actions or to build
    history (undo-redo) mechanism.
error
    Error messages and error handling cluster.
formatter
    Formatter classes for IO operations or string handling.
support
    Miscellaneous classes.

A more detailed documentation for this library will be provided in
future releases.
