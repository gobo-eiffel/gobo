Version 3.10 - ?

	geant:

	* Extended the attributes 'if' and 'unless' to accept the values
	  "true" and "false". This can be useful when automatically generating
	  geant build files. See bug#2657770.
	* Use ISE Eiffel's ec instead of ecb, so output is compatible with
	  estudio; else estudio will complain about a corrupted project.

	gec:

	* Added option --gelint to force the whole content of classes to be
	  checked (even features not reachable from the root creation procedure).
	* Fixed bug in the generated C code for call agents whose feature was
	  FUNCTION.item or ROUTINE.call and whose closed argument was a manifest
	  tuple. See bug#2997112.
	* Fixed implementation of class IDENTIFIED_ROUTINES. Object addresses
	  were casted to INTEGER_32, which causes loss of information when
	  compiled on a 64-bit computer. See bug#2999209.
	* Fixed type system bug when processing constant attributes in
	  inspect instructions. See bug#3238111.
	* Fixed bug when an inspect instruction had no else-branch. No exception
	  was raised.
	* Fixed bug when running 'gec --gelint ...'. Validity errors were
	  reported twice.
	* Qualified anchored types are now accepted by default.

	gelint:

	* Fixed bug where it was reporting an internal error instead of a VTCT error
	  when the type of a local variable was a generic class type whose base class
	  did not exist.
	* Report a VIPR-3 error for inline agent of the once and external forms.
	  This is not in ECMA 367-2, but a restriction in ISE.
	* Qualified anchored types are now accepted by default.

	getest:

	* Set exit code to 4 when at least one of the test cases has been aborted.
	* Split the feature `build_suite' in smaller routines in the generated test
	  harness so that the back-end C compiler (in particular MSVC under Windows)
	  can compile the generated C code for this routine in a reasonable amount
	  of time.
	* Added command-line options to the generated test harness to monitor which
	  of the registered test cases should be executed or ignored.
	* Improved command-line processing of the generated test harness.

	gexace:

	* Added option "syntax" to support the corresponding option in ECF.
	* Added documentation explaining how to add a new option in Xace.

	geyacc:

	* When specifying Eiffel types in the %token and %type clauses, in addition
	  to what was accepted so far, it is now possible to use 'like Current',
	  labeled tuples (e.g. 'TUPLE [i, j: INTEGER; s: STRING]') and type marks
	  such as 'expanded', 'reference', 'separate', 'attached', 'detachable',
	  '!' and '?'. See bug#2618271.
	* When declaring '%token <EIFFEL_TYPE> ...', the generated parser
	  expects to find token values in the variable `last_<eiffel_type>_value',
	  where all non-alphanumeric characters in the type name EIFFEL_TYPE
	  are replaced by underscores. It is now possible to customize the
	  name of this variable to `last_<alias_name>_value' by declaring
	  '%token <EIFFEL_TYPE as alias_name> ...'. See bug#2621302.
	* Added support for qualified anchored types in %type and %token declarations
	  in .y files.
	* Eiffel classes need to be regenerated with geyacc from .y files because
	  of a breaking change to make the internal stacks void-safe compliant.
	  Otherwise this will result in a compilation error.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Added features `same_*_pathnames' to class KI_FILE_SYSTEM.
	* Features `test' in class KL_EQUALITY_TESTER and `equal_objects' in
	  class KL_ANY_ROUTINES now use the new ECMA construct '~' instead
	  of the combination `same_type' and then `is_equal'.
	* Added feature `is_true' to class KL_AGENT_ROUTINES.
	* Fixed bug in feature `read_to_string' of file classes where the
	  hash code was not reset properly.

	Gobo Eiffel Lexical Library:

	* Fixed bug in LX_DFA_REGULAR_EXPRESSION where `compile ("foo\$")' was
	  setting `has_dollar' to True even though the dollar sign was escaped.
	* Added features `pattern' and `is_case_insensitive' in class LX_PATTERN_MATCHER.

	Gobo Eiffel Regexp Library:

	* The pattern being matched and the case-sensitiveness are now available
	  using queries `pattern' and `is_case_insensitive'.

	Gobo Eiffel String Library:

	* Fixed bug in the string formatter where the flags '+' and space where
	  not taken into account. See bug#2768748.

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* Fixed assertion violation in feature `compress' from DS_SPARSE_CONTAINER.
	  See bug#2831433.
	* Relaxed precondition of `put' and `put_last' in classes DS_SET and
	  DS_SPARSE_TABLE (i.e. the ancestors of DS_HASH_SET and DS_HASH_TABLE) to
	  be "not is_full or else has (k)" instead of just "not is_full".
	* Added features `do_until' and `do_if_until' to DS_CONTAINER and its
	  descendants.
	* Added feature `has_void' to DS_CELL and DS_PAIR.
	* Fixed bug in features `force_last_new' and `put_last_new' of DS_HASH_TABLE.
	* Fixed bug in DS_HASH_TABLE when the calls to `key_equality_tester' in 
	  `search_position' trigger the invariant which internally calls `search_position'.
	   But this routine was not written to be re-entrant. 

	Gobo Eiffel Time Library:

	* Added class DT_STOPWATCH in cluster 'stopwatch'.

	Gobo Eiffel Tools Library:

	* Added support for keyword 'note' as a replacement of 'indexing'.
	  See bug#2499770.
	* Fixed bug where object-test local was not recognized as such when
	  appearing as target of an agent declaration.
	* Fixed bug where the type of an agent was not correctly determined
	  when the result type of the corresponding function contained a formal
	  generic parameter. It ended up being 'FUNCTION [ANY, TUPLE, BOOLEAN]'
	  instead of 'PREDICATE [ANY, TUPLE]'. See bug#2667604.
	* Only pre-ECMA formats were supported for integer manifest constants.
	  Now all formats (decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary) are supported
	  to be compliant with ECMA and ISE. See bug#2682414.
	* Support the new syntax, using keywords, for attached and detachable
	  types (e.g. 'attached FOO' or 'detachable BAR') and for object-tests
	  (e.g. 'attached {T} exp as x' with '{T}' and 'x' optional). See
	  bug#2682694.
	* Added the notion of ignored classes. We can programmatically decide
	  to ignore the class from a cluster and take it into account later on
	  after some processing.
	* Added support for attribute initialization body.
	* Added support for renaming clause in libraries when parsing ECF files.
	* Fixed pretty-printer when processing indexing clauses in features.
	  An extra empty line was inserted.
	* Added support for check instructions with a then-branch.
	* Added support for once keys in once routines.
	* Improved the way the type of a manifest array is determined in the
	  case where the types of all items conform to one of them. In that
	  case the manifest array will be an array of that type.
	* The scope of object-test locals can cover the following assertions
	  in the same postcondition or invariant clause because it's as if
	  they were separated by "and then" operators. It was already
	  implemented that way in preconditions.
	* Support the ECMA syntax for typed manifest strings and typed character
	  constants.
	* Accept class text files which start with the byte order mark (BOM).
	  (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark.)
	* Started checking void-safety validity rules.
	* Relaxed the validity rule to prevent cycles in qualified anchored types
	  so that it can accept code appearing in ISE's libraries.
	* Added support for across instructions/expressions.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* Added option to let the XML pretty printer use empty element tags
	  <tag/> instead of <tag><tag/>.

	Miscellaneous:

	* Removed classes and features that had been marked as obsolete
	  in 2004 or before.
	* Removed warnings when compiling with ISE 6.6.

Version 3.9 - 20 November 2008

	geant:

	* Removed support for SmartEiffel task <se>.

	gec:

	* Fixed some C compilation warnings when using gcc as back-end C compiler.
	  See bug#1961462.
	* Added support for object equality ('~' and '/~'). Equality expressions
	  ('=' and '/=') now use the semantics of object equality when the operands
	  are dynamically of expanded types.
	* Added experimental support for Qualified Anchored Types (types of the
	  form 'like a.b' or 'like {A}.b).

	gelint:

	* Fixed bug where no validity error was reported when a creation procedure
	  of a creation instruction did not exist in the base class of the creation
	  type.

	getest:

	* Added an indexing clause "generator" to the generated classes.
	  See feature request bug#1961466.
	* Provided programmatic access to test results.
	* Removed support for config file 'getest.se' and option --se.

	gexace:

	* Made sure that several options 'override_cluster' can be specified
	  in Xace files.
	* Fixed bug when generating ECF files from Xace files: the override
	  clusters were not marked as such.
	* Removed support for SmartEiffel config files.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Added `make_from_string_general' and `make_from_substring_general'
	  in class UC_STRING.

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* Added set and table classes using binary search tree, AVL tree,
	  red-black tree and left-leaning red-black tree algorithms.
	* Added features `there_exists_with_key' and `for_all_with_key' to class
	  DS_TABLE.

	Gobo Eiffel Tools Library:

	* Added minimal support for ECF files.
	* Improved Eiffel pretty-printer.

	Miscellaneous:

	* Removed the emulations of EiffelBase and EiffelTime in library/other.
	  They had not been maintained for years, and it became a pain to use
	  them after the move from Ace files to ECF files in EiffelStudio.

Version 3.8 - 11 May 2008

	geant:

	* Changed the evaluation of attributes 'if' and 'unless' so that an
	  empty right/left side of the equals sign is treated as an empty string
	  which makes comparisons easier. Also leading/trailing white space for
	  the equals sign is not removed anymore to leave control to the script
	  developer. Note that this might cause a problem to scripts which made
	  use of the old behavior. These scripts need to be adapted.
	* Task 'geant' has a new attribute called 'exit_code_variable'. It can be
	  used to capture (or ignore) the execution result of a '<geant>' call
	  and works exactly as in the 'exec' task.
	* Introduced notion of locals, and globals. You can now declare
	  '<local name="varname"/>'.
	* Added support for '<group>' element.
	* Fixed various issue with '<replace>' task.

	gec:

	* Generate prototypes for external routines when no header file
	  has been specified.
	* Changed the generated C code for Agent objects so that `twin'
	  and `deep_twin' work correctly.
	* Improved CAT-call error reporting, in particular in case of
	  Tuple label assigners.
	* Relaxed the CAT-call rule when calling Agents to be compliant with ISE.
	  ISE Eiffel does not type-check the tuple operand of Agent calls even at
	  execution time. It only checks whether the tuple has enough items and
	  these items are of the expected types, regardless of the type of the
	  tuple itself. For example it is OK to pass a "TUPLE [ANY]" to an Agent
	  which expects a "TUPLE [STRING]" provided that the dynamic type of the
	  item of this tuple conforms to type STRING.
	* Made sure that no-more-memory exceptions are raised when needed.
	* Made sure that expanded items are initialized when creating objects
	  of type SPECIAL.
	* Fixed bug (read/write to non-allocated memory) in implementation of
	  `deep_twin' when traversing objects of type SPECIAL.
	* Fixed bug when both the expanded and reference versions of a non-generic
	  type were used in the system. The generated C code considered that they
	  were either both expanded or both reference.
	* Fixed bug in recursive once-functions. The second call was returning
	  the default value of the result type instead of the value of 'Result'
	  as it was when the recursive call occurred, as specified in ECMA Eiffel.
	* The Xace option 'garbage_collector' is now taken into account by gec
	  when set to "boehm". This Xace option can be overridden by the
	  command-line option --gc when specified.
	* When gec compiles an application with the Boehm GC, it now generates
	  code that will let the GC trigger the feature `dispose' when objects
	  are reclaimed.
	* Take better advantage of the Boehm GC, using 'GC_malloc_atomic' when
	  possible.
	* The implememtation of the rescue mechanism in C uses 'setjmp' and
	  'longjmp'. The use of these two C functions requires that any local
	  variable modified between the call to 'setjmp' and the call to 'longjmp'
	  to be declared as 'volatile', otherwise its value may be lost after
	  calling 'longjmp' if the C optimizer decided to implement it with
	  'register'. For more details, see:
	     http://www.programmersheaven.com/articles/pathak/article1.htm
	     http://www.freetype.org/david/reliable-c.html#annex-A
	     http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xe7acxfb(VS.80).aspx
	  The generated C code has been adapted accordingly.

	gelint:

	* Fixed bug in the flat Degree 3 mode where the precursor features
	  corresponding to precursor expressions or instructions were not checked.
	* Fixed bug when the type in a manifest type is based on an unknown class.
	  Instead of reporting a VTCT error, gelint/gec were reporting another
	  subsequent error, as shown in bug#1875262.
	* Made sure that no VAPE error is reported when a feature is exported
	  to a class that has a syntax error or for which the ancestors could
	  not be computed.
	* Added support for the notion of libraries as specified in ECF.
	  This introduced some breaking changes if you are using the code of
	  gelint in your own applications. For example what was known as
	  ET_UNIVERSE is now called ET_SYSTEM and ET_UNIVERSE is now an
	  ancestor of this class (and of the new class ET_LIBRARY).
	* Added type-marks '!' and '?' (part of void-safety mechanism) in the
	  parser. But do not check validity rules yet.
	* Implemented Object-Test as specified in ECMA 367-2.
	* Do not accept the obsolete syntax for Agents using '~'. ECMA Eiffel
	  uses the operator for object equality, and this new construct is
	  now implemented in ISE 6.2.

	getest:

	* Added features `assert_doubles_equal_with_tolerance' and
	  `assert_doubles_equal_with_strict_tolerance' to TS_ASSERTION_ROUTINES.
	* getest now expects test case classes to declare `make_default' inherited
	  from TS_TEST_CASE as creation procedure. That way there is no need to
	  generate intermediary classes (e.g. classes of the form XTEST_...
	  inheriting from TEST_...) anymore, and hence it is easier to call test
	  cases outside of the test framework.
	* Removed the command-line option --ve and replaced it by --ge.
	* Print the exception trace if available when an exception occurred
	  while running a test case.
	* Make sure that the garbage collector is in the same state as before
	  running each test case.

	gexace:

	* The option '--system=ise' now generates ECF directly instead of going
	  through Ace which is then converted to ECF by EiffelStudio. This
	  allow Xace to support options that have been introduced in ECF. In
	  order to generate Ace files for ISE, use the new command-line option
	  '--format=ace'.
	* The option '--system=ge' now generates an Xace file instead of an
	  Ace file. This makes it possible for example for 'gec' to determine
	  whether the Boehm GC should be used through the Xace option
	  'garbage_collector'. Otherwise, with Ace files, this information has
	  to be passed to 'gec' through the command-line option '--gc=boehm'.
	  In order to generate Ace files for 'gec', use the new command-line
	  option '--format=ace'.
	* These ECF options have been added to Xace: supplier_precondition,
	  automatic_backup, check_generic_creation_constraint, ecf_library,
	  enforce_unique_class_names, external_runtime, force_32bits,
	  full_class_checking, msil_classes_per_module, msil_culture,
	  msil_key_file_name, msil_use_optimized_precompile, namespace,
	  old_verbatim_strings. See $GOBO/doc/gexace/options.txt for more
	  details.
	* The default value of these Xace options has been changed to follow
	  the default value in ECF: inlining, inlining_size,
	  use_cluster_name_as_namespace, use_full_cluster_name_as_namespace.
	  See $GOBO/doc/gexace/options.txt for more details.
	* Fixed bug#1875809 where libraries were duplicated in the generated
	  output file when appearing twice in the same Xace input file.

	geyacc:

	* Fixed bug when resuming a parsing that was suspended (with `suspend').
	  The last action before the call to `suspend' was executed twice.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Added iterator features (`do_all', `do_if', `for_all', `there_exists')
	  in class KL_DIRECTORY.
	* Added feature `prune_all_trailing' to KL_STRING_ROUTINES.
	* Improved class KL_EXCEPTIONS to make it clearer what is available
	  for all Eiffel compilers and what is not.
	* Added KL_MEMORY and friends to provide a compiler independent way
	  to access garbage collection facilities.
	* Upgraded Unicode support to version 5.1.0.

	Gobo Eiffel Regexp Library:

	* Fixed bug#1917556 where feature `split' in RX_PCRE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
	  was not behaving correctly when the regexp could match empty strings.

	Gobo Eiffel String Library:

	* Added full Unicode case-mapping routines.
	* Upgraded Unicode support to version 5.1.0.
	* Added support for formatting dates and times according
	  using the picture strings from the XSLT functions
	  format-date(), format-time() and format-date-time().

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* Moved features `do_all', `do_if', `there_exists' and `for_all'
	  up to class DS_CONTAINER.
	* Added features `do_all_with_key' and `do_if_with_key' to class
	  DS_TABLE.
	* Added feature `has_void' to class DS_SEARCHABLE.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* Re-implemented XPath fn:collection() for file URIs (incompatibly,
	  but as the previous implementation was not documented, it
	  almost certainly is not used). Wrote documentation.
	* Added additional XSLT system-properties, and the ability to
	  register additional system properties. Documented this.
	* Added facility to pass XPath values as global XSLT parameter values.

Version 3.7 - 5 November 2007

	gec:

	* Can generate console and Windows applications.
	* Implemented once manifest strings.
	* Report CAT-call errors and call-on-void-target errors at run-time.
	* Support the Ace/Xace/ECF 'trace' option.
	* The Boehm GC can be plugged using the --gc command-line option.
	* Improved the back-end C compiler config file.
	* Improved interoperability with ISE's compiler.
	* Support 'external "C++"' routines.
	* Implemented feature `deep_twin'.
	* Added support for lcc-win32 and MinGW as back-end C compilers.

	gelint:

	* Fixed bug when determining the type of a call to a Tuple label
	  when appearing in a generic class.
	* Added support for some incrementality when used within the same session.

	Gobo Eiffel Argument Library:

	* Added the possibility to specify a maximum number of options.
	* Added the possibility to make option arguments optional for options
	  that only have a long form.
	* The contracts now certify that the setup of arguments are
	  unambiguous.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Removed possible CAT-call when using KL_EQUALITY_TESTER. It does not
	  use `is_equal' directly, but a protected version of it which is preceded
	  by a call to `same_type'.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* Made the XSLT serializer a reusable component for any XML programs.
	* Added an example of using the XSLT serializer.
	* Added documentation on XML serializers, including the reusable
	  XSLT serializer.

Version 3.6 - 14 June 2007

	gec:

	* Implemented inline agents.

	Gobo Eiffel String Library:

	* Fixed a bug in string formatter where format("$11.9f",941.65899999999817)
	  would return 942.589999910 instead of 941.659000000. Regression tests
	  have been added, and this fix also pointed out a bug in one of the
	  test cases.

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* Added iterator features (`do_all', `do_all_with_index', `do_if',
	  `do_if_with_index', `there_exists') to relevant classes.
	* Fixed bug in invariant of DS_MULTIARRAYED_SPARSE_SET and
	  DS_MULTIARRAYED_SPARSE_TABLE when `capacity' is zero.

	Miscellaneous:

	* Now uses the MIT License, which is an OSI Approved License and
	  a GPL-Compatible Free Software License.
	* Bugs can now be reported on SourceForge bug tracker.
	* Does not support Visual Eifel compiler anymore. Indeed Visual Eiffel
	  does not support Agents, Tuples, INTEGER_64 among other things. The
	  Gobo project tried not to use these constructs so far, but this is
	  becoming too constraining.

Version 3.5 - 23 January 2007

	geant:

	* Fixed bugs which prevented that possible arguments of a target
	  to be taken into account during evaluation of ${somevar} references.
	  This was especially the case for the attributes 'if' and 'unless'.
	* Task <geant> now by default spawns a new geant process if
	  attribute 'file' has been specified. It also has a new attribute
	  called 'fork' to control whether a new process should be spawned
	  or not.
	* Added attribute 'force' to task <xslt>. Use this attribute to
	  generate output that already exists and is newer than the input.
	* Added task <input> to get input values.
	* Added task <replace> to replace tokens or patterns in a file.

	gec:

	* First version of the Gobo Eiffel Compiler (gec) that is able to
	  compile everything in the Gobo package. However gec is not a
	  full-fledged Eiffel compiler yet. See the documentation for more
	  details.

	getest:

	* Added command-line option --default_test to specify whether the
	  feature `default_test' should be included in the generated test
	  cases.

	gexmlsplit:

	* Has been removed. Use gexslt instead.

	Gobo Eiffel Argument Library:

	* New command-line argument parsing library.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* KL_WINDOWS_FILE_SYSTEM now accepts both \ and / as directory
	  separator. This is the default. It can still accept only \
	  as directory separator if you use the `make_backslash_only'
	  creation procedure.
	* Change semantics of KI_FILE_SYSTEM.absolute_parent_pathname when
	  the argument is both a root directory (i.e. has no parent) and an
	  absolute pathname. In that case return the argument itself instead
	  of `absolute_root_directory' as before.
	* Fixed bug in KL_(UNIX|WINDOWS)_FILE_SYSTEM.absolute_parent_pathname.
	  When the result was a root directory it was erroneously returning
	  `absolute_root_directory'. So if you were in 'C:\gobo' and asked for
	  the `absolute_parent_pathname' of 'D:\foo' you were getting 'C:\'
	  instead of the expected 'D:\'.
	* Fixed bug in KL_WINDOWS_FILE_SYSTEM.canonical_pathname which for the
	  input '\\gobo\foo\..' was returning the invalid pathname '\\gobo\'
	  instead of '\\gobo\foo'. Likewise for 'c:\..', we were getting
	  'c:\..' instead of 'c:\'.
	* Added `sharename' to KI_PATHNAME, so that UNC pathnames can be
	  split into '\\hostname\sharename'.
	* Added classes for determining the class of Unicode
	  characters. Also updated code for conversion to lower and
	  upper case, and added code for conversion to title case.
	  These are generated from the Unicode Character Database.
	  Currently Unicode version 5.0.0 is supported.
	* New features have been added to a new ancestor of ISE's STRING
	  class in order to support the classes STRING_32 and STRING_8
	  which have been introduced at ECMA. As a consequence, the
	  following features had to be renamed in class UC_STRING:
	      put_code -> put_item_code
	      append_code -> append_item_code
	      has_code -> has_item_code
	      index_of_code -> index_of_item_code
	  The new names are not great, but they match the feature `item_code'.

	Gobo Eiffel Math/Decimal Library:

	* Added creation procedure `make' to MA_DECIMAL_TEXT_PARSER and
	  MA_DECIMAL_BCD_PARSER.
	* Renamed MA_DECIMAL_CONSTANTS as MA_DECIMAL_CONTEXT_CONSTANTS and
	  MA_DECIMAL_MATH as MA_DECIMAL_CONSTANTS.
	* Added class MA_SHARED_DECIMAL_CONSTANTS.
	* Moved `Maximum_integer_as_decimal' and `Minimum_integer_as_decimal'
	  from MA_DECIMAL_CONTEXT_CONSTANTS to MA_DECIMAL_CONSTANTS and
	  renamed them as `maximum_integer' and `minimum_integer'.
	* Moved `default_context' from MA_DECIMAL_CONTEXT to MA_SHARED_DECIMAL_CONTEXT.
	* Added a comment in MA_SHARED_DECIMAL_CONTEXT.set_shared_decimal_context
	  emphasizing the fact that it is best practice to call this routine
	  once and for all at the beginning of the application to avoid unexpected
	  behaviors.

	Gobo Eiffel Parse Library:

	* Added feature `suspend' (and its associated feature `is_suspended')
	  to YY_PARSER and its descendant YY_PARSER_SKELETON to be able to
	  suspend the current parsing. The next call to `parse' will resume
	  parsing in the state where the parser was when it was suspended.
	  Note that a call to `abort' or `accept' will force `parse' to parse
	  from scratch.

	* Changed implementation of feature `syntax_error' in YY_PARSER_SKELETON
	  so that it returns false when nothing has been parsed yet.

	Gobo Eiffel String Library:

	* Added classes for normalizing Unicode strings.

	* Removed useless precondition of feature `make_with_separators'
	  in ST_SPLITTER.

	Gobo Eiffel Time Library:

	* Added classes to parse and format XML Schema date, time and
	  date-time datatypes.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* XSLT and XPointer are now sufficiently stable and mature to be
	  considered supported. XPath is supported for its use with
	  XSLT and XPointer as host languages, but a general interface
	  for host languages is not yet supported.

Version 3.4 - 10 July 2005

	geant:

	* Task <echo> supports writing message to a file.
	* Targets support argument handling. Tasks <geant> and <precursor>
	  have been modified so that they are able to pass these arguments.
	* Targets support 'obsolete' mechanism.
	* Tasks <exit>, <ise>, <se>, <ve> support capturing the return code
	  of the called process.
	* Task <available> supports checking for availablity of directories.
	* If you use xsltproc and pass string parameters to it, you have to
	  surround those parameters with single quotes now.
	* Task <ve> supports VE 5.0 with the attribute 'xace' to specify
	  Xace files. Attribute 'esd' is still supported when using VE 4.1.
	* Added built-in variable 'verbose' which is set (to 'true') when
	  geant is run in verbose mode.
	* Added attributes 'verbose', 'abort', 'generation', 'compilation'
	  and 'execution' to task <getest>.

	gexace:

	* Removed support for 'hact'.
	* Added support for VE 5.0: 've' now generates Xace files for VE 5.0.
	  In order to generate ESD for VE 4.1 use 've41' instead.

	gelex:

	* Added command-line option '--pragma=[no]line' in order for
	  the code generated for the semantic actions to contain or
	  not indication about the line number where it originally
	  appeared in the input description file.
	* Fixed bug in '%option line' with the -z option when two rules
	  were sharing the same semantic actions (with | separator).
	* When not appearing in a character class, an unescaped [ character
	  is now considered to be the open character of a character class
	  and reports an error if there is no matching ] character. It used
	  to be considered as a non-special character when there was no
	  matching ] character.

	geyacc:

	* Following the changes made in version 3.2, YY_PARSER_SKELETON is
	  not a synonym of YY_OLD_PARSER_SKELETON anymore and can now be
	  used as a replacement of YY_NEW_PARSER_SKELETON. Also the default
	  command-line option is now '--new_typing'.
	* Added command-line option '--pragma=[no]line' in order for
	  the code generated for the semantic actions to contain or
	  not indication about the line number where it originally
	  appeared in the input description file.
	* Added command-line option '--doc=(html|xml)' to generate
	  documentation about the grammar in HTML or XML format.

	getest:

	* Added command-line options '--verbose' and '-v' to run
	  getest in verbose mode.
	* In verbose mode getest prints the number of test cases
	  that have been generated.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* XM_DOCUMENT.process_to_events makes the tree an event source.
	* New XM_XMLNS_GENERATOR filter injects xmlns declarations
	  in event stream. It can be combined with a print filter.
	* XM_FORMATTER is now a wrapper for the above and so
	  produces XML compliant output.
	* XM_INDENT_PRETTY_PRINT_FILTER and XM_WHITESPACE_NORMALIZER
	  added to allow pretty indented output.
	* XM_NAMESPACE_RESOLVER has new option to forward
	  xmlns attribute events (forward_xmlns).
	* XM_DTD_CALLBACKS: `on_doctype' called first; `on_dtd_end',
	  `on_dtd_comment', `on_dtd_processing_instruction' added.
	* New XM_XMLID_VALIDATOR validates xml:id attributes.
	* Parser defaults to new STRING-only latin-1 mode.
	* Parser correctly outputs PUBLIC identifier in DOCTYPE.
	* Parser leaves XML resolver in correct state.
	* XM_PARSER.positions contains full info to locate errors
	  in external entities.
	* Eiffel parser accepts UTF8 files that start with a BOM.
	* Expat parser accepts genuine UC_STRINGs as input.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Fixed bug in KL_PATHNAME.set_canonical.
	* Added bit operation features to KL_INTEGER_ROUTINES.
	* Added features `power', `div' and `mod' to KL_INTEGER_ROUTINES.
	* Added feature `log2' to KL_DOUBLE_ROUTINES.
	* Added feature `truncated_to_integer' to KL_DOUBLE_ROUTINES because
	  this routine is not supported anymore in SE 2.2b1.
	* Added class KL_CLONABLE. This class should be used whenever
	  the corresponding objects need to be cloned. This is the
	  consequence of `clone' not being supported anymore in SE 2.2b1.
	  If you need to clone strings or arrays, use `cloned_string'
	  by inheriting from KL_IMPORTED_STRING_ROUTINES and `cloned_array'
	  by inheriting from KL_IMPORTED_ARRAY_ROUTINES. To a clone a
	  SPECIAL object, just call `twin' on it (does not work with
	  ISE 5.4, but works with ISE 5.5).
	* KL_PLATFORM.Double_bits is not supported with SE 2.1 and 2.2b1
	  anymore. This is a consequence of DOUBLE being deprecated in
	  SmartEiffel and hence not supporting the required features.
	* UC_STRING.infix "@" does not work as expected with SE 2.1. It
	  works well with the SE 2.2b and SE 1.0 though. This is the
	  consequence of the fact that STRING.infix "@" as been marked
	  as frozen in SE 2.2b1.

	Gobo Eiffel Math/Decimal Library:

	* New library, incorporated from the SAFE project (http://safe.sf.net).
	* Contains MA_DECIMAL, which provides Decimal floating-point arithmetic,
	  with unrounded and integer arithmetic as a subset
	  (IEEE 754R + IEEE 854 + ANSI X3.274 + ECMA 334).

	Gobo Eiffel String Library:

	* New library.
	* Contains the Formatter Library (note that unlike the imported
	  library, the array-based formatter requires DS_CELL items for
	  basic types, rather than accepting the _REF types).
	* ST_SPLITTER: parse a string to and from lists of tokens.

	Gobo Eiffel Time Library:

	* Support clocks with precision to the millisecond. However
	  note that with SmartEiffel under Windows the millisecond part
	  may be stuck to zero.
	* Better support for days of the week.
	* Added support of week number of dates.

	Gobo Eiffel Utility Library:

	* UT_URI path is parsed into components: `path_items'.
	* UT_HOST_PORT: new class for TCP hostname and port number.

Version 3.3 - 2 November 2003

	geant:

	* Fixed bug in task <gepp> occurring when a nested <fileset>
	  element defined in the new format was specified.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* XM_EIFFEL_PARSER.disable_namespaces allows multiple
	  colons in names (strict XML compliance).

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Removed usage of 'like argument' (will be removed from the
	  Eiffel language because it was a disguised way of providing
	  overloading in Eiffel) in features `substring', `to_lower',
	  `to_upper', `as_lower' and `as_upper' in KL_STRING_ROUTINES.

Version 3.2 - 29 June 2003

	geant:

	* Element <fileset> uses a new format. The old format is
	  still working but an obsolete-message will be shown when applied.
	* Added optional attribute 'export' which takes a comma separated
	  list of project names to which the given target is exported.
	* Added new command-line option -t (--targets) to list targets
	  and their descriptions.
	* Added new task <available>.
	* Added subelement <directoryset> to task <delete>.
	* Added attributes 'class' and 'feature' to task <getest>.
	* The task <hact> now takes advantage of Halstenbach incremental
	  compiler.
	* Added attributes 'old_typing' and 'new_typing' to task <geyacc>.

	geyacc:

	* Made the semantic values more type-safe. Now the parser
	  skeleton class is not generic anymore, and there is one
	  different stack generated per declared type in the %type
	  or %token clauses. Geyacc also generates the corresponding
	  attributes `last_<type>_value' instead of `last_value'
	  to be used to set the semantic values of tokens.
	  Transition path: If you still want to use the old typing
	  mechanism (now made obsolete), use geyacc with the command-
	  line option --old_typing or with geant's attribute 'old_typing'
	  in task <geyacc>. It is also recommended that you replace
	  class YY_PARSER_SKELETON by YY_OLD_PARSER_SKELETON in your
	  code. Alternatively you can now switch to the new typing
	  mechanism using geyacc's --new_typing command-line option
	  or attribute 'new_typing' in task <geyacc> in geant. In
	  that case you will have to use the non-generic class
	  YY_NEW_PARSER_SKELETON instead of YY_PARSER_SKELETON and
	  replace the calls to `last_value' by the corresponding
	  `last_<type>_value' in your code. In the next release
	  YY_PARSER_SKELETON will stop to be a synonym of
	  YY_OLD_PARSER_SKELETON and will be used as a replacement
	  of YY_NEW_PARSER_SKELETON. In the release after, the old
	  typing mechanism will not be supported anymore, classes
	  YY_OLD_PARSER_SKELETON and YY_NEW_PARSER_SKELETON will be
	  removed, and you will have to use YY_PARSER_SKELETON along
	  with the `last_<type>_value' attributes in your code.

	getest:

	* Added command-line options --class and --feature to pass
	  the regexps for tested class names and feature names as
	  argument instead of through the 'class' and 'feature'
	  fields of the config file (needed by Guy Fokou).
	* Better formatting of the message when `assert_equal' or
	  `assert_not_equal' fail (suggested by Berend de Boer).

	Gobo Eiffel Lexical Library:

	* Renamed `convert' as `convert_to_equivalence' in class
	  LX_SYMBOL_CLASS because 'convert' is a keyword in ETL3.

	Gobo Eiffel Tools Library:

	* Big chunks have been redesigned. Still under development.

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* Eiffel parser now accepts 'iso-8859-1' encoding.
	* Tree formatter now produces valid XML.
	* Tree node parent not void (when not the root node) implemented
	  where missing and creation procedures updated accordingly. Also
	  for the root element, so that `root_node' returns the real
	  root (XM_DOCUMENT). XM_NODE.level consequently offset by 1.
	* XM_COMPOSITE now a read-only list. Modification routines
	  are in XM_ELEMENT and XM_DOCUMENT (typing is used to allow
	  only the correct node types to be added).
	* XM_COMPOSITE descendants' modification routines remove
	  a node from its previous parent if any. They also have
	  `make_last' creation routines that add the node to the
	  composite. `make_last' is faster than `make', `force_last'.
	* XM_NODE.parent_element added, root_node now XM_DOCUMENT.
	* XM_NAMESPACE stricter contracts and uri invariant,
	  `is_default' replaced by `not has_prefix', removed rather
	  than obsoleted due to SmartEiffel's ANY using the name.
	* XM_DOCUMENT.set_root_element now exported to ANY.
	* XM_NAMESPACE_RESOLVER now issues empty strings (the default
	  namespace) rather than the parent element's namespace for
	  on_attribute events in the case of unprefixed attributes.
	  (XML Names says unprefixed attributes have no namespace.)
	* XM_ELEMENT.*attribute_by_name only look for unprefixed
	  attributes, for the same reason as above.
	* Added _by_qualified_name routines to tree nodes.
	* XM_FORMATTER.last_string replaced by .last_output stream.
	* XM_NODE_TYPER.attribute obsoleted and renamed to `xml_attribute'
	  to avoid future keyword collision.

	Miscellaneous:

	* Now uses the Eiffel Forum License version 2, which is an OSI
	  Approved License and a GPL-Compatible, Free Software License.

	* Does not support Halstenbach compiler anymore. Indeed Halstenbach
	  does not seem to maintain/release their Eiffel compiler on their
	  Web site anymore and a poll among the Gobo users has shown that
	  it was not worth the effort to continue supporting this out-of-date
	  compiler in Gobo.

Version 3.1 - 18 December 2002

	gelex:

	* Feature YY_BUFFER.content is now of type KI_CHARACTER_BUFFER
	  instead of KL_CHARACTER_BUFFER (Berend de Boer).

	geant:

	* The task <ise> now takes advantage of ISE Eiffel incremental
	  compiler.

	getest:

	* Fixed bug: only the first cluster listed in the config file
	  was taken into account (reported by Guy Fokou).

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Moved feature `close' up to KI_INPUT_STREAM and
	  KI_OUTPUT_STREAM and added feature `is_closable'
	  (suggested by Franck Arnaud).
	* Made sure that `hash_code' in UC_STRING returns the same value
	  when `same_string' returns true.

	Gobo Eiffel Lexical Library:

	* LX_NFA: Renamed `infix "|{n,}|"' as `infix "|{*}|" and `infix "|{n}|"'
	  as `infix "|{}|"' because the former free operator is not valid in ETL3
	  anymore (and SE 1.0b6 already supports the new syntax). All the free
	  operators of this class have been made obsolete.

	Gobo Eiffel Time Library:

	* DT_DATE: Renamed `infix "&d"' as `infix "&@" because the former
	  free operator is not valid in ETL3 anymore (and SE 1.0b6 already
	  supports the new syntax).
	* DT_TIME: Renamed `infix "&t"' as `infix "&|" because the former
	  free operator is not valid in ETL3 anymore (and SE 1.0b6 already
	  supports the new syntax).

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library:

	* Tree: `namespace' in named nodes is now an object, which
	  contains URI and prefix. It may be shared.
	* Tree: `*_by_name' routines check the namespace is the same.
	* Tree: `is_first' and `is_last' in XM_COMPOSITE for
	  checking position within parent.
	* Tree: added `elements' to XM_COMPOSITE.

Version 3.0 - 1 September 2002

	gelex:

	* Added feature `wipe_out' to YY_BUFFER and YY_FILE_BUFFER,
	  which is useful in order to avoid invariant violation when
	  reusing the same input buffer for subsequent scanning.
	  (suggested by Emmanuel Stapf)
	* Options specified on the command-line now override those
	  specified in the %option directives of the input file
	  (reported by Sven Ehrke).

	geyacc:

	* Added command-line options '-k' and '--tokens-file': name
	  of the file where the tokens class will be written
	  (reported by Sven Ehrke).
	* Do not generate unused local variables anymore.
	* Do not generate unused $N type conversion routines, nor
	  conversion routines for the generic parameters of these
	  types. This caused Eiffel compilation errors when the
	  generic parameter was a formal generic parameter
	  (reported by Zoran Simic).
	* Fixed bug in default rule when the declared type is a basic
	  expanded type. For example when the declared type in the
	  %type section was INTEGER, the default rule was trying to
	  set $$ to Void instead of 0 (reported by Emmanuel Stapf).

	getest:

	* Added command-line options: -g for testcase generation
	  only, -c for testcase compilation only, and -e for
	  testcase execution only (suggested by Glenn Maughan).
	* Added assertion routines to compare file contents and
	  filenames.
	* Added command-line option --compile to pass the
	  Eiffel compilation command-line as argument instead of
	  through the 'compile' field of the config file.
	* Added command-line options -D and --define to define
	  variables which will be passed to the command running
	  the test cases.
	* The 'testgen' directory is now created by 'getest' if
	  it does not exist yet.
	* Do not try to run the test anymore when the command
	  specified for the Eiffel compilation exists with a
	  status code other than zero.

	gepp:

	* Added command-line options --lines and -l in order to
	  generate empty lines whenever lines are ignored from
	  the input file. That way line numbers are preserved.
	  (suggested by Alexander Kogtenkov)

	geant:

	* First release (contributed by Sven Ehrke).

	gexace:

	* First release (contributed by Andreas Leitner, currently
	  maintained by Eric Bezault).

	gexmlsplit:

	* First release (contributed by Andreas Leitner).

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* No need for 'include_path' in the Ace file anymore in
	  order to use KL_STRING_BUFFER_ROUTINES with ISE Eiffel.
	  Use new routines introduced in class POINTER in ISE
	  Eiffel 4.5 instead.
	* Added cluster $GOBO/library/kernel/io with directory,
	  file and file-system functionalities.
	* Added cluster $GOBO/library/kernel/misc with miscellaneous
	  kernel classes.
	* Added cluster $GOBO/library/kernel/unicode with Unicode
	  support classes (based on the work from Majkel Kretschmar).

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* Fixed bug in feature `force_last' of DS_SPARSE_SET and
	  DS_SPARSE_TABLE when resizing the container.
	* Changed postconditions in DS_LINEAR_CURSOR and
	  DS_BILINEAR_CURSOR which prevented descendants to
	  implement partial traversals or different traversal
	  strategies (reported by Berend de Boer and Einar
	  Karttunen).
	* Fixed bug in HASH_TABLE related to the new implementation
	  in ancestor class DS_SPARSE_TABLE (reported by Emmanuel
	  Bouyer).
	* Fixed bug in LINKED_LIST.cursor_back (reported by Paul Ford).

	Gobo Eiffel Time Library:

	* Fixed bug related to the implementation of features `date'
	  and `time' in DATE_TIME and DATE_TIME_DURATION (reported
	  by Emmanuel Bouyer).
	* Added feature `set_storage' to DT_DATE and DT_TIME.
	* Fixed bug in feature `add_minutes' of DT_DATE_TIME
	  (reported by Glenn Maughan).
	* Fixed bug in feature `set_from_epoch_days' of DT_DATE
	  when the resulting date in 1 January 1600 (reported by
	  Emmanuel Bouyer).
	* No need for 'include_path' in the Ace file anymore in
	  order to use DT_SYSTEM_CLOCK with ISE Eiffel.
	* Added class DT_UTC_SYSTEM_CLOCK.
	* Added creation routine DT_DATE_TIME.make_from_epoch.

	Gobo Eiffel Pattern Library:

	* New library with design pattern classes.
	* Moved $GOBO/library/utility/command cluster to
	  $GOBO/library/pattern/command and change class
	  name prefix from UT to DP.
	* Added feature `exit_code' to class DP_SHELL_COMMAND.

	Gobo Eiffel Regexp Library

	* New library for regular expression handling. Contains a
	  implementation based on the PCRE package (contributed
	  by Harald Erdbruegger based on his ePCRE library).

	Gobo Eiffel XML Library

	* New library for XML parsing and XML tree handling
	  (contributed by Andreas Leitner based on his eXML
	  library, and by Franck Arnaud based on his NenieXML
	  parser. The library has been redesigned and is
	  currently maintained by Franck Arnaud).

	Miscellaneous:

	* The Gobo project is now taking full advantage of 'geant'
	  and 'gexace' instead of Makefiles (which were not portable
	  across platforms).

Version 2.0 - 29 April 2001

	geyacc:

	* Geyacc now generates the routine `token_name' along
	  with the token codes to make the debugging messages
	  more human-readable (suggested by Andreas Leitner).

	gelex:

	* Added debugging instructions at the end of routine
	  `read_token' in classes YY_COMPRESSED_SCANNER_SKELETON,
	  YY_INTERACTIVE_SCANNER_SKELETON and YY_FULL_SCANNER_SKELETON.
	  One need to compile the system with 'debug ("GELEX")'
	  enabled. The routine `print_last_token' can be redefined
	  in descendant classes to print more debugging information.
	  In particular, the routine `token_name' generated by geyacc
	  can be used to make the debugging output more human-readable.
	  (suggested by Andreas Leitner)

	getest:

	* First release.

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* Added argumentless creation routine `make_default' to
	  most containers. In resizable containers `make_default'
	  is equivalent to `make (default_capacity)' where
	  `default_capacity' is a constant (10) defined in class
	  DS_RESIZABLE (suggested by Franck Arnaud).
	* DS_SORTER and descendant classes now use DS_COMPARATOR
	  as comparison criterion (suggested by members of the
	  SmallEiffel mailing list).
	* Added class DS_TOPOLOGICAL_SORTER to sort partially
	  ordered items.
	* Added DS_SET and descendant classes such as DS_HASH_SET
	  and DS_MULTIARRAYED_HASH_SET.
	* DS_HASH_TABLE: added creation routine `make_map' in
	  order to compare keys with '=' instead of `equal'.
	* DS_HASH_TABLE: added features `remove_found_item',
	  `found_key' and `force_last'.
	* Added class DS_MULTIARRAYED_HASH_TABLE with the same
	  interface as DS_HASH_TABLE but implemented with a
	  sequence of fixed size arrays instead of a single array.
	  This might be useful for hash tables containing a very
	  large number of items.
	* Fixed bug in DS_LINKED_LIST.delete (reported by Emmanuel
	  Bouyer).
	* Fixed bug in QUEUE.{force, put, extend}: removed erroneous
	  postcondition "item_pushed" (reported by Emmanuel Bouyer).
	* Moved $GOBO/library/structure/base to $GOBO/library/
	  structure/other/EiffelBase.
	* Moved cursor classes next to their associated containers
	  and removed cluster $GOBO/library/structure/cursor.

	Gobo Eiffel Time Library:

	* First release.

	Miscellaneous:

	* Removed comments in 'loadpath.se' files which caused
	  problems on AmigaDOS (suggested by Thomas Aglassinger).
	* Added Makefiles in various directories.

Version 1.6 - 20 August 2000

	geyacc:

	* One can now use manifest strings (e.g. "<=" or "..")
	  in place of identifiers (e.g. LE or DOTDOT) in grammar
	  rules (suggested by Berend de Boer).
	* Anchored types are now accepted in %type declarations.
	* Improved format of tokens in verbose file (suggested
	  by Roger Browne).
	* Added ISE's language extensions to the Eiffel parser
	  example (suggested by Patrick Flaherty).
	* The Eiffel parser example now accepts empty Eiffel
	  source files (suggested by Alexander Kogtenkov).
	* Added a few words in the documentation about the Eiffel
	  debug instructions spread out in the parser skeleton
	  class (suggested by Francis Drai).

	gelex:

	* Added redefinable routine `default_action' to YY_SCANNER
	  when default rule is matched (suggested by David Massart).
	* Added `pre_action' and `post_action', called when
	  %option pre-action and %option post-action are specified
	  (suggested by Alexander Kogtenkov).
	* Added `pre_eof_action' and `post_eof_action', called when
	  %option pre-eof-action and %option post-eof-action are
	  specified.
	* Added '%option line' to generate code for line and column
	  counting (suggested by Alexander Kogtenkov).
	* Added '%option position' to generate code for character
	  counting since the beginning of the input source.
	* Fixed bug when the input buffer contains a null character
	  (reported by Emmanuel Stapf).
	* Fixed bug when scanning a token larger than the size of
	  the input buffer (reported by Emmanuel Stapf).

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* DS_TRAVERSABLE: removed postcondition from routine
	  `valid_cursor' and made `internal_cursor' deferred
	  (suggested by Andreas Leitner).
	* DS_SEARCHABLE: added features `same_items' and
	  `same_equality_tester'.
	* DS_ARRAYED_LIST, DS_ARRAYED_STACK: got rid of garbage
	  (i.e. old items at indexes count+1..capacity) in
	  removal features.
	* DS_TABLE, DS_SPARSE_TABLE, DS_HASH_TABLE: added
	  feature `put_new'.
	* DS_SPARSE_TABLE, DS_HASH_TABLE: added feature
	  `replace_found_item'.
	* DS_SPARSE_TABLE, DS_HASH_TABLE: new optimized
	  implementation (requested by Jacques Bouchard).
	* DS_SPARSE_TABLE: added feature `key'; optimization
	  of feature `force' (avoid unnecessary resizing).
	* HASH_TABLE: optimization of features `put' and
	  `force' (avoid unnecessary resizing).
	* DS_SORTER: Added features `reverse_sort' and
	  `reverse_sorted'.

	Gobo Eiffel Kernel Library:

	* Added class KL_DIRECTORY to allow Eiffel compiler
	  portable directory access.

	Gobo Eiffel Utility Library:

	* Fixed bug in feature `append_decimal_integer' from
	  class UT_INTEGER_FORMATTER when dealing with negative
	  values.

Version 1.5 - 2 October 1999

	geyacc:

	* Fixed bug in verbose mode: the useless rules and
	  nonterminals were not displayed properly (reported
	  by Berend de Boer).
	* Fixed bug when dealing with two consecutive semantic
	  actions in a rule (reported by Alexander Kogtenkov).
	* Fixed bug whereby the end-of-file was not recognized
	  properly (reported by Patrick Doyle).
	* Updated documentation to state that the Eiffel type
	  for the semantic of a mid-rule action is the same
	  type as declared for the full grouping (reported by
	  Andreas Auras).

	Gobo Eiffel Structure Library:

	* The documentation has been greatly improved.
	* Added a `test' directory as a starting point for
	  a test suite.
	* Added a cluster containing an implementation of the
	  main EiffelBase classes based on the Gobo containers.
	* Added support for internal iterations (a la EiffelBase).
	  Some feature renaming was necessary: routines with an
	  external cursor as argument, such as `put_right',
	  have been renamed with the `_cursor' suffix, as in
	  `put_right_cursor'. The original feature names have
	  been reused by the internal traversal interface, e.g.
	  `put_right' inserts an item to the right of the
	  internal cursor position.
	* Cursors are always kept valid. There is no need for
	  calls to `a_cursor.is_valid' anymore.
	* DS_LINEAR_CURSOR does not inherit from DS_INDEXED_CURSOR
	  anymore.
	* Added classes DS_QUEUE and DS_LINKED_QUEUE.

Version 1.4 - 14 April 1999

	* Multiple types for semantic values now supported
	  in geyacc.
	* In geyacc, $$ entities are now initialized to their
	  default Eiffel values at the beginning of semantic
	  actions and the default for missing actions is "{}"
	  (it used to be "{$$ := $1}" as in yacc and Bison).
	* Added warning/error in geyacc when $N in a semantic
	  action does not match with a symbol in the rule.
	* Fixed bug in output of geyacc verbose mode (option -v).
	* Routine `clear_all' from YY_PARSER_SKELETON clears
	  internal stacks by default (call to `clear_stacks').
	* Added two new types in $GOBO\library\kernel:
	  STRING_BUFFER and FIXED_ARRAY (array with lower
	  bound equal to zero). These two types are used
	  instead of STRING and ARRAY in gelex and geyacc
	  skeleton classes for optimization purposes.
	  STRING_BUFFER maps either to SPECIAL [CHARACTER]
	  or STRING, and FIXED_ARRAY [G] maps either to
	  SPECIAL [G] or ARRAY [G] depending on the Eiffel
	  compiler used. Only ISE Eiffel port has been
	  optimized so far. SmallEiffel port can be optimized
	  as well using FAST_ARRAY [G] or NATIVE_ARRAY [G].
	* Added features `Empty_buffer', `append_text_to_string'
	  and `append_text_substring_to_string' to YY_SCANNER.
	* Added a precondition to routine `set_start_condition'
	  in class YY_SCANNER.
	* Resize input buffer if a call to `unread_character'
	  results in too much text being pushed back (it was
	  raising a run-time error in previous releases).
	* Added command-line option -x to gelex and geyacc
	  to allow the generation of semantic actions in
	  separate routines.
	* Added command-line option -z to gelex to force the
	  generated code to use an "inspect" instruction to
	  find out which action to execute. The default is to
	  use binary-search implemented with "if" instructions.
	* Fixed operator precedence bug in "$GOBO\example\
	  parse\eiffel\eiffel_parser.y".

Version 1.3 - 15 August 1998

	* Geyacc has been totally rewritten in Eiffel.
	* Replaced attribute `output_file' by procedure
	  `output' in class YY_SCANNER to avoid unnecessary
	  console creation in Windows mode with Visual Eiffel.
	* Fixed bug in gelex in "equivalence class" mode when
	  dealing with regular expressions of the form x{4}.
	* Added warnings in gelex when a rule cannot be
	  matched and when the default rule can be matched
	  despite the %option nodefault or -s option.
	* Renamed classes KL_SHARED_*_ROUTINES as
	  KL_IMPORTED_*_ROUTINES. (The old class names are
	  still temporarily valid using the classes in cluster
	  "$GOBO\library\kernel\obsolete".)
	* Gepp now supports #include "filename" instructions.
	* The second generic parameter of DS_HASH_TABLE is now
	  constrained to HASHABLE (HASHABLE was not part of
	  SmallEiffel in previous releases).
	* Cluster `error' has been added to the Gobo Eiffel
	  Utility Library to support a flexible error
	  reporting mechanism.

Version 1.2 - 17 December 1997

	* New implementation for variable trailing context
	  in gelex, with warnings for dangerous trailing
	  contexts of form such as x*/xz*.
	* Improved documentation.

Version 1.1 - 29 October 1997

	* Bug fixed wrt variable trailing context in gelex.

Version 1.0 - 14 October 1997

	* First public release.
	* Gold Award at the Eiffel Class Struggle '97.
