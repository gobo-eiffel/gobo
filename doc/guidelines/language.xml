<title>Eiffel Language</title>

<para>
In order to achieve Eiffel compiler interoperability, it is not necessarily 
required to strictly follow the Eiffel standard. Some compilers indeed have bugs, 
do not interpret the standard in the same way as others (be it because of 
ambiguities in the standard itself or not), or have implementation limitations.
Therefore the Eiffel dialect used in <projectname>Gobo Eiffel</projectname> is 
likely to be a subset of the official Eiffel standard.
</para>

<para>
On the contrary, constructs which have not been officially adopted by 
<ulink url="http://www.eiffel-nice.org/">NICE</ulink> yet but which are already 
supported by all Eiffel compilers can be used in 
<projectname>Gobo Eiffel</projectname>. This is for example the case for the
<constructname>Precursor</constructname> construct. However it is clear that an 
Eiffel extension can be used in <projectname>Gobo Eiffel</projectname> only if it 
is supported by all <link linkend="compilers">Eiffel compilers</link>. Therefore 
the <constructname>agent</constructname> construct introduced in 
<ulink url="http://www.eiffel.com">ISE Eiffel</ulink> should not be used at the 
moment.
</para>

<para>
Differences between the <link linkend="compilers">supported Eiffel compilers</link> 
which have been already noticed, along with workarounds when available, will be 
listed on-line in order to help others to avoid making the same mistakes by using 
these non-portable Eiffel constructs.
