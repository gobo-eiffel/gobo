   <i>Gobo Eiffel Lint</i> is specially designed 
   to be used in Continuous Integration cycles. For example, each time
   a developer commits some changes in the Source Control repository,
   we want to be sure that no Eiffel compilation error has been 
   introduced. And this has to run fast in order to get feedback
   as soon as possible, before someone else commits other changes.
   Most of us will use our favorite Eiffel compiler and try to compile
   our Eiffel system in order to figure out whether our code still
   compiles correctly or not. But some Eiffel compilers do not check
   the validity of dead code (Eiffel code which is not reachable from
   the root creation procedure). Some other Eiffel compilers just
   take too long to compile the Eiffel system and therefore are not
   suitable as a Continuous Integration job. For example, at work
   we have to deal with 20,000 Eiffel classes. Following are benchmarks
   when using <font color="#800000"><i><tt>ec.exe</tt></i></font> or <font color="#800000"><i><tt>ecb.exe</tt></i></font>
   from ISE to check the validity of our Eiffel classes
   (in non-void-safe mode and non-full-class-checking mode):
   <pre>
	<font color="#800000"><i><tt>ec.exe -config integration.ecf</tt></i></font>
		21 minutes
		RAM: 3.6 GB
		EIFGEN: 1.8 GB
</pre>
   <pre>
 	<font color="#800000"><i><tt>ecb.exe -config integration.ecf</tt></i></font>
 		16 minutes
 		RAM: 3.5 GB
 		EIFGEN: 1.8 GB
</pre>
   It's way too slow when part of a Continuous Integration cycle.
   <i>gelint</i> has been designed with this
   constraint in mind. First, it keeps all data about the Eiffel
   system in memory. No temporary files are written to disk. This
   makes the process run faster since memory accesses are much
   faster than disk accesses. In order to fit everything in 
   memory, <i>gelint</i> only keeps track
   of what is strictly necessary in order to analyze the Eiffel
   code and to report useful messages in case of validity errors.
   For example the Gobo Eiffel parser can be configured to ignore
   comments, note clauses, etc. which are Eiffel constructs
   with no validity rules associated with them. Furthermore,
   the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is built in such a way that 
   whenever an object can be shared, it will not be duplicated.
   After all these data fit into memory, the next design goal
   of <i>gelint</i> is to avoid the best that
   it can to create temporary objects. This avoids having a
   garbage collector which spends too much time reclaiming the
   memory for these objects instead of using these CPU cycles to
   actually analyze the Eiffel system under inspection. To achieve
   that, <i>gelint</i> uses extensively the
   Visitor Pattern, having objects traversing the AST to perfom
   some specific tasks rather than having each node in the AST
   perform these tasks themselves. That way these visitor objects
   can reuse the same intermediate objects when performing these
   tasks on the various nodes of the AST rather than having these
   intermediate objects being created by each AST node. Following
   are the benchmarks when using this technology:
   <pre>
 	<font color="#800000"><i><tt>gelint.exe integration.ecf</tt></i></font>
		41 seconds
		RAM: 2.0 GB
		No disk usage
</pre>
   This is much more acceptable for a Continuous Integration job.
   In this benchmarks <font color="#800000"><i><tt>gelint.exe</tt></i></font> is almost
   25 times faster than <font color="#800000"><i><tt>ecb.exe</tt></i></font>. In fact at
   work we are using <i>gelint</i> in 
   full-class-checking mode, with the following results:
   <pre>
 	<font color="#800000"><i><tt>gelint.exe --flat integration.ecf</tt></i></font>
		1 minute 19 seconds
		RAM: 2.1 GB
		No disk usage
</pre>
   which is still acceptable in our Continuous Integration cycle.
   Starting with <i>Gobo Eiffel</i> 4.2, 
   <i>gelint</i> can now take advantage of multi-threading. 
   Following are the results on a 4-CPU machine in full-class-checking mode:
   <pre>
 	<font color="#800000"><i><tt>gelint.exe --thread=4 --flat integration.ecf</tt></i></font>
		29 seconds
		RAM: 2.1 GB
		No disk usage
</pre>
   Note that these benchmarks are when <font color="#800000"><i><tt>gelint.exe</tt></i></font>
   has been compiled with <i>gec</i> (the 
   <i>Gobo Eiffel Compiler</i>) and executed
   with no GC. When using the Boehm GC, it will be slower by about
   1 or 2 seconds and the memory usage will go down to 1.7 GB.

   At work we have been using <i>gelint</i>
   for more than 10 years, and it was very successful at finding
   Eiffel validity rule violations with clear error messages.
   Some of my colleagues sometimes tell me that they better understand
   the error messages from <i>gelint</i> than
   those from ISE <i>EiffelStudio</i>.
   Apart from that, <i>gelint</i> and 
   <i>EiffelStudio</i> will catch the
   same errors most of the time. It is even possible that from
   time to time <i>gelint</i> will report
   validity errors that <i>EiffelStudio</i>
   would have missed. On the other hand, if you find cases
   where <i>gelint</i> would have missed
   a validity error, please report it to me so that I can fix
   this issue.
