Error code: VTMC(2)

Error: Cannot call feature on formal generic type because more than one
       constraining type has a feature with that name.

What to do: Make sure that the name of the feature is unambiguous:
         Apply a renaming to the feature names of the constraining
         types in such a way that the name of the feature you want
         to call is unique.

Class: BB [G -> {CC, DD}]
Feature: f
The feature `+' occurs in the following set of constraint classes:

	{CC}.f  from formal G at constraint position #1.
	{DD}.g  from formal G at constraint position #2.
