Error code: VGCC(1)

Error: Creation instruction applies to target of generic type
   which does not have a suitable creation constraint.
What to do: Make sure that the constraint has a creation part
   and that it lists the feature you need.
   For an abstract creation (create x) a version of
   `default_create' from `ANY' is required.

Class: BB [G -> {CC, DD}]
