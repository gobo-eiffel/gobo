Configuration error: There is an inconsistency between the Root clause
  of the ecf file and the creation clause of the system's root
  class
What to do:
  1) If the system's root class has a creation procedure: make
     sure that the name listed in the Root clause is that of a
     feature which is a creation procedure of the root class
  2) If the system's root class does not have a creation procedure:
     make sure that that the Root clause does not list a creation
     procedure.

Root class: AA
Invalid procedure name: make
