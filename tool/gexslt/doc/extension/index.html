   All extensions are in the namespace <font color="#008080">http://www.gobosoft.com/eiffel/gobo/gexslt/extension</font>.
   
  </p>
  <div>
   
   <h2>Extension attributes</h2>
   
   <p>
    The following extension attributes are available:
    
    <dl>
     	
     <dt><font color="#008080">explain</font></dt>
     <dd>
      	      This attribute may be set on any instruction in the stylesheet, or on a literal result element. The permitted values
      are "yes", "no" and "all". 
      	      If the value is "yes", then at compile time an analysis of all XPath expressions appearing as attributes of that element
      is written to the standard
      	      error stream. The analysis includes the static type of the expression, and a representation of the expression tree
      that results from parsing and optimization.
      	      The tree structure is represented by indentation.
      	    
      <p>
       	      The value of "all" only takes effect on xsl:stylesheet and xsl:transform elements. It is treated as if "yes" was coded.
       	      Additionally, if this is the prinicpal stylesheet, then the instructions themselves, when compiled to an expression,
       	      have their compiled form displayed. (Only xsl:templates, top-level xsl:variables and xsl:params, and xsl:function definitions
       	      are displayed.)
       	      
       <p><font color="#FF0000">This can produce a lot of output.</font></p>
       	    
      </p>
     </dd>
     	
     <dt><font color="#008080">memo-function</font></dt>
     <dd>
      	      
      <p><font color="#FF0000">
        	       This attribute used to make gexslt non-compliant. It is now ignored. Use the gexslt:function extension instruction
        instead.
        	      </font></p>
      	    
     </dd>
     
    </dl>
    
    <div>
     
     <h3>Extension attributes for xsl:output</h3>
     
     <dl>
      	
      <dt><font color="#008080">character-representation</font></dt>
      <dd>
       	      This tells the serializer how to serialize non-ASCII characters, and characters that are not representable
       	      in the selected encoding.
       	      
       <p><font color="#FF0000">
         		This may need to be dropped - I have to check the serialization specs, but I think they have been tightened to disallow
         		some of this.
         	      </font></p>
       	    
       <p>
        	      When the output method is "xml" or "xhtml" 
        <p><font color="#FF0000">(Hm.maybe xhtml should follow the html behaviour)</font></p>,
        	      this parameter only effects characters that are not representable
        	      in the selected encoding. It can take on the value "hex" or "decimal", and it determines whether 
        	      the character is written out with a decimal character reference, or a hexadecimal 
        	      character reference (the default).
        	    
       </p>
       <p>
        	      When the output method is "html", then the value may hold two strings, separated by a semicolon.
        	      The first string defines how non-ASCII characters within the character encoding will be represented, 
        	      the values being "native", "entity", "decimal", or "hex". 
        	      The second string defines how characters outside the encoding will be represented, the values being 
        	      "entity", "decimal", or "hex". Here "native" means output the character as itself; "entity" means 
        	      use a defined entity reference (such as "&amp;eacute;") if known; "decimal" and "hex" refer to numeric 
        	      character references. For example "entity;decimal" (the default) means that with encoding="iso-8859-1", 
        	      characters in the range 160-255 will be represented using standard HTML entity references, while 
        	      Unicode characters above 255 will be represented as decimal character references.
        	    
       </p>
       <p>
        	      This parameter has no meaning when the output method is "text". For <font color="#008080">QName</font> output methods,
        	      it's interpretation is up to the programmer of the method, but the possible values are those for the 
        	      "html" method.
        	    
       </p>
      </dd>
      	
      <dt><font color="#008080">indent-spaces</font></dt>
      <dd>
       	      This tells the serializer how many spaces to add for indentation when <font color="#008080">indent="yes"</font> is specified.
       	      It is ignored when <font color="#008080">indent="no"</font> is specified, or is omitted and the default
       	      for the serialization method is "no". If you omit this parameter, then three spaces are used 
       	      (but check the creation procedure for <font color="#008080"><i><tt>XM_XSLT_OUTPUT_PROPERTIES</tt></i></font> to confirm
       	      this, in case it gets changed and I forget to update the documentation).
       	      
       <p><font color="#FF0000">
         	       TODO: Change the default to indent with a single tab.

      </dd>
      	
      <dt><font color="#008080">next-in-chain</font></dt>
      <dd>
       	      This is only allowed in conjunction with the <font color="#008080">gexslt:chain</font> output method.
       	      It's value is the URI of the next transformation to be run over the output.
       	    
      </dd>
      	
      <dt><font color="#008080">method</font></dt>
      <dd>
       	    This is only allowed on <font color="#008080">xsl:result-document</font>, and it specifies the method used
       	    to store the resource. For HTTP, only PUT and POST are permitted. PUT is the default. Other schemes
       	    allow any value and ignore it.
       	   
      </dd>
      
     </dl>
     
    </div>
    
   </p>
   
  </div>
  <div>
   
   <h2>User-defined data elements</h2>
   
   <p>
    The <font color="#008080">fn:doc(), fn:collection() and fn:document()</font> functions are defined to be stable by default.
    That is, repeated use of one of these functions on the same URI will result in the identical document node (or 
    collection of document nodes in the case of <font color="#008080">fn:collection()</font>). But to implement this the library
    is forced to lock the documents in memory for the duration of the transformation. 
    This can cause severe performance problems, especially with large
    collections. For that reason, an implementation is allowed to provide options that allow other isolation levels
    (in the SQL sense - the default behaviour corresponds to SERIALIZABLE).
    
   </p>
   
   <p>
    This option is provided through an experimental user-defined data element <font color="#008080">isolation-level</font>, which is ignored
    unless it is a top-level element in the principal stylesheet module.
    This has a compulsory attribute (in the per-element partition, not in the gexslt namespace)
    <font color="#008080">isolation-level</font>. This takes one of the four values:
    
    <ul>
     <li>read-uncommitted</li>
     <li>read-committed</li>
     <li>repeatable-read</li>
     <li>serializable</li>
    </ul>
    
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The effect of this implementation, is that documents or collections specified as read-committed (or read-uncommitted) will
    not be locked in memory. If the same URI is passed to one of these functions a second time, then the document(s) will be read
    and parsed by the XML parser a second time. This will break the usual guarantee of node identity.
    
    <p><font color="#FF0000">
      This user-defined data element is experimental. I intend to eventually move towards a more transaction-oriented solution.
      Support for this user-defined data element may then be dropped (note that this will not cause errors in stylesheets that
      use it - it will then have no effect (other than to issue a warning)).
      </font></p>
    
   </p>
   
   <p>
    There is also <font color="#008080">collation</font>.
    This is intended for declaring collation-URI names, but as the only collation supported is
    the default one at the moment, it is not much use (I use it for binding additional URIs to the default collation,
    to test the collation-naming mechanism). When a tailorable collation based on the Unicode Collation Algorithm is
    available, then this will be used to bind URI names to tailored collations.
    
   </p>
   
  </div>
  <div>
   
   <h2>Extension instructions</h2>
   
   <div>
    
    <h3>Gexslt:function</h3>
    
    <p>
     <font color="#008080">gexslt:function</font> is identical in syntax to xsl:function. However it is implemented as a memo-function
     for performance.
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     If the function has any side effects (which can only occur if it uses
     user-written extension functions with side-effects), or if it access context information, such as position(),
     last() or the context item, then you may not get what you expect.
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     If the function constructs and returns a temporary tree, the same tree will be returned each time. The only consequence
     of this is if you compare node identities on that tree. 
     
    </p>
    
   </div>
   
   <p>
    <font color="#008080">gexslt:serialize</font> may be defined in the future. Or maybe not.
    Users can always use <a href="http://xmlportfolio.com/xml-to-string/">Evan Lenz's serializer written in XSLT 1.0</a>.
    (I think an XSLT 2.0 html serializer has also been written).
    
   </p>
   
  </div>
  <div>
   
   <h2>Additional output methods</h2>
   
   <p>
    The only supplied method is <font color="#008080">gexslt:chain</font>, which delegates serialization to a further
    transformation, sepecified by the <font color="#008080">gexslt:next-in-chain</font> attribute. Consquently all other
    attributes on the <font color="#008080">xslt:output</font> element are ignored.
    
   </p>
   
   <p>
    There is also an example provided to show Eiffel programmers
    how to write their own output methods. This is in the namespace 
    <font color="#008080">http://www.gobosoft.com/eiffel/gobo/gexslt/extension/example</font>, and has
    a local name of <font color="#008080">xml</font>. It functions identically to the standard
    <font color="#008080">xml</font> method, unless the extension attribute <font color="#008080">internal-subset</font> (in the same
    namespace) is supplied. In which case, it's value is used as the text for a DTD internal subset. You
    must also supply <font color="#008080">doctype-system</font> for this to work.
    
   </p>
   
  </div>
  <div>
   
   <h2>Extension functions</h2>
   
   <div>
    
    <h3>gexslt:transformation</h3>
    
    <p>
     This function allows you to run an XSLT transformation from within your current XSLT transformation. Syntax
     is <font color="#008080">gexslt:transformation ($trans-uri as xs:string, 
      $initial-context as node()?, 
      $initial-template as xs:QName?, 
      $initial-mode as xs:QName?,
      $parameter-names as xs:QName*,
      $parameter-values as item()*,
      $features as xs:string?) as item()+</font></p>
    
    <p>or
     <font color="#008080"> gexslt:transformation ($trans-uri as xs:string, $initial-context as node()) as item()+</font>
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     The two-argument form is equivalent to passing () for all remaining arguments.
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     The meaning of the arguments is as follows:
     
    </p>
    
    <ol>
     <li>The URI of the transformation to be run</li>
     <li>An optional initial context node</li>
     <li>An optional initial template</li>
     <li>An optional initial mode</li>
     <li>
      	The $parameter-names are names of global stylesheet parameters.
      
     </li>
     <li>
      	The $parameter-values lists must be of the same length as the $parameter-names list.
      	It contains values of the stylesheet parameter named in the corresponding position in the $parameter-names list.
      
     </li>
     <li>
      	The $features string consists of a white-space separated list of <font color="#008080">xs:QName</font>-valued features.
      	No features are defined at this stage. I have various stylesheet-caching control features in mind, and general
      	options such as which tree-model to use.
      
     </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
     If the stylesheet fails to compile, then the error return value will be COMPILE_FAILED in the gexslt namespace.
     If there is no initial template, and no initial context node, then the error return value will be NO_INITIAL_TEMPLATE in the
     gexslt namespace.
     If the number of parameter names and values are unequal, then the error return value will be PARAMETER_MISMATCH in the gexslt
     namespace.
     If an unrecognized feature name is supplied, then the error return value will be UNRECOGNIZED_FEATURE in the gexslt namespace.
     Otherwise, the error return value will be a standard XPath or XSLT error code, or a normal gexslt error code,
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     The result sequence has one of two forms:
     
     <ol>
      <li>
       	 An <font color="#008080">xs:QName</font>,  followed by an <font color="#008080">xs:string</font> forllowed by <font color="#008080">item()*</font>
       representing the components of the error from the transformation (see <font color="#008080">fn:error()</font>).
       
      </li>
      <li>Zero or one<font color="#008080">document-node()</font>s. The document will be the implicit result document if one exists.
      </li>
     </ol>
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Result documents can be serialized using the <font color="#008080">gexslt:serialize</font> extension instruction (if I ever write it).
     
    </p>
    
   </div>
   
   <div>
    
    <h3>gexslt:response-body</h3>
    
    <p>
     This function returns any available response data, as a single string, as a result
     of storing an <font color="#008080">xsl:result-document</font>. It takes a single string argument (required), whose
     value must be the same as the (resolved) value of the <font color="#008080">href</font> attribute on the <font color="#008080">xsl:result-document</font>.
     If no such response data is available then the error return value will be NO_RESPONSE in the gexslt namespace.
     
    </p>
    
    <p>
     This is principally intended for use with <font color="#008080">http</font> URIs, but any scheme that supports responses to store requests
     can use it. Database requests spring to mind.
